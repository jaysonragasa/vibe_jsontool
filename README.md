### Data Visualization (Powered by D3.js)
Transform your JSON data into insightful graphs with two distinct visualization modes:

* **Tree Layout:** Display the data in a clean, hierarchical tree diagram.
* **Interactive Controls:**
    * Zoom and pan for detailed inspection.
    * Drag nodes to rearrange the layout (Network Graph).
